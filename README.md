## Water mark embedding and extraction with MATLAB
### TASK 1
Write a MATLAB script to demonstrate the above two MATLAB functions
watermark_embed() and watermark_extract() work as designed (5 marks each).
The script should test at least one textual string and at least one binary image as the watermark.

### TASK 2
For one selected parameter of the digital watermarking scheme, write a MATLAB
script to calculate the PSNR values of watermarked images (5 marks) and to show how they
change w.r.t. the parameter using a 2-D plot.
